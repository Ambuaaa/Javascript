/*   First, what is a prototype?
Every JavaScript object has a hidden [[Prototype]] property, which links it to another object (often called its "parent" or "prototype").
This is how inheritance works in JavaScript.

// let myName = "Abhishek"

// console.log(myName.length); // 8
// But if we do 

let myName = "Abhishek        " // 8 spaces

console.log(myName.length); // 16 

// Suppose we do not want this . 
// We want to make a new property named - "trueLength" which takes the input 
// and print = "The true length of the string is ${proper value}" and removes all spaces

// console.log(myName.trueLength) ; // we want to make this

String.prototype.trueLength = function(){
    console.log(`The true length of the string is ${this.trimEnd().length}`);

myName.trueLength() ; // The true length of the string is 8
"govinda".trueLength() ; // The true length of the string is 7

// We only gave power to the Arrays 
Array.prototype.heyabhishek = function(){
    console.log("hello bhai ");

/*-------------------------------------
üß± At the top of the chain:
"Object.prototype" is the root prototype

Every object (and even arrays and functions!) inherits from it

So if you add a method to Object.prototype, it becomes available in all objects

/*
‚ö†Ô∏è----- Important Warning:-------

‚ùó Never use Object.prototype to add custom methods in real projects.

Why?

It affects all objects globally ‚Üí can cause conflicts in libraries

//-----------Inheritance -----------------

}

Teacher.__proto__ = User // now Teacher can use the property of all the user


console.log(Teacher.name); // "Amarpaaaali" ‚Üí inherited from User
console.log(Teacher.email); // "amarpaali@gmail.com" ‚Üí inherited
console.log(Teacher.makeVideo); // true 
// But this is outdatedd

//-------Modern syntax----------

//1) setPrototypeof() 
Object.setPrototypeOf(TeachingSupport, Teacher) // Inherited both TeachngSupport and Teacher
